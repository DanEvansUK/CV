  <p>Here I worked as an IT helpdesk technician in Ysgol Ystalyfera Comprehensive. My daily duties included general IT support, hardware replacement, and troubleshooting. I have gained experience in networking, hardware upgrading/troubleshooting, and
    software experience.</p>
  <h4>McDonalds</h4>
  <p>I worked as part of a team with the aim to give the best experience to our customers by providing fast and efficient service. Working at McDonald's has taught me to be as efficient as possible whilst being able to communicate with my colleagues.
    The role requires me to be efficient and face-paced while maintaining a high quality for customers.</p>
  <h4>Go Air</h4>
  <p> I worked in the cafe taking orders for customers and making coffee offering excellent customer service. My duties also involved cleaning the waiting area before customers use guidelines to maintain cleanliness in the kitchen. I have developed
